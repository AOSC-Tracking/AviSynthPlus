InterleavedImageFormat
======================

When talking about interleaved and :doc:`PlanarImageFormat <PlanarImageFormat>` the main difference
is how they are store in memory.

Interleaved images have all color components needed to represent a pixel
placed at the same place in memory.

Some examples of interleaved formats are RGB24, RGB32, YUY2.
